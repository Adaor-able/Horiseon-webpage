# Horiseon Social Solutions Webpage

## Description 

This project was created with several goals in mind:

1. To make a webpage for Horiseon Social Solutions that is accesible to users who may have a disability or physial impairment. 

2. Another important goal was to make the code of the webpage more descriptive so that it can be easily understood, changed and updated by anyone. 

3. The main goal of the project was to improve search engine optimization for the Horiseon website by ensuring the webpage adhered to accessibility standards.

We have achieved these goals through the addition of descriptive elements that explain what the browser is displaying, and using semantic coding techniques.
